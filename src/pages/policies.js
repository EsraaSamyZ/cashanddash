          <strong>California Online Privacy Protection Act</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial
          websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach
          stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in
          the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites
          collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California
          consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating
          exactly the information being collected and those individuals or
          companies with whom it is being shared. - See more at:

          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</strong>
          &nbsp;Users can visit our site anonymously. Once this privacy policy
          is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum,
          on the first significant page after entering our website. Our Privacy
          Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be found on the
          page specified above.
          <br />
          <br />
          You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes:

          <strong>How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?&nbsp;</strong>
          We honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use
          advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?</strong>
          &nbsp;It's also important to note that we allow third-party behavioral
          tracking

          <br />
          <strong>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          When it comes to the collection of personal information from children
          under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy
          Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade
          Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the
          COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online
          services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.
          <br />
          <br />
          We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years
          old. Do we let third-parties, including ad networks or plug-ins
          collect PII from children under 13?

          <strong>CAN SPAM Act</strong>

          The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email,
          establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the
          right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out
          tough penalties for violations.
          <br />
          <br />
